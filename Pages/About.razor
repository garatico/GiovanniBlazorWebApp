                    <p> I'm a Data Science major with a background in Web Development, set to graduate this year. I'm passionate about using data to solve complex problems and create actionable insights. My expertise lies in programming languages like Python, C#, and R. I'm also skilled in web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    <p> What sets me apart is my background in web development, which has given me a unique perspective on how data can be used to enhance user experiences and drive engagement. Whether it's designing a web dashboard to showcase key metrics or building a dynamic data visualization, I'm always looking for ways to use data to inform and inspire.

                    <p> In my free time, I enjoy making music and playing video games, which allows me to flex my creative muscles and unwind. I'm excited to bring my passion for data and web development to a new challenge and make a positive impact on a team or organization.
